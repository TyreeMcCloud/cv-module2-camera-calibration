Step 1: Calibrate your camera

Put your checkerboard photos in the calibration_images/ folder.

Open your terminal and run:
python3 callibration.py
When it's done, it will create a file called camera_params.json.

Step 2: Measure an object

Take a photo of an object from at least 2 meters away and put it in test_images/.
Open projection_measure.py and change the Z variable to the exact distance you stood from the object (in mm).

Run the script:

python3 projection_measure.py
Clicking: A window opens. Click the top-left corner of the object, then the bottom-right corner.
press ENTER

The real-world width and height will print in the terminal and on the Image.
